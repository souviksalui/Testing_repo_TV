C:\Users\USER>locust -v

'locust' is not recognized as an internal or external command,

operable program or batch file.




Show thinking
This error occurs because the command prompt doesn't know where to find the locust.exe program. The installation warnings you received tell you exactly why: the directory C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\Scripts was not added to your system's PATH environment variable.

## What is the PATH?
Think of the PATH as a list of directories that your command prompt checks every time you type a command. If the executable file (like locust.exe) isn't in any of the folders on that list, you get the 'is not recognized' error. Your installation put locust.exe in a folder, but didn't tell Windows to look for it there.

## How to Fix It (Permanent Solution) ðŸ”§
You need to add the scripts folder to your PATH environment variable.

Open Environment Variables:

Press the Windows Key + S to open the search bar.

Type Edit the system environment variables and press Enter.

Navigate to Path:

In the System Properties window that opens, click the Environment Variables... button.

In the top box ("User variables for USER"), find the variable named Path and select it. Click Edit....

Add the New Path:

Click New.

Paste the path from your warning message into the new field:
C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\Scripts

Click OK on all the open windows to save the changes.

Restart Your Terminal:

This is a crucial step! Close your current command prompt window and open a brand new one. The changes won't apply to any terminal windows that were already open.

Now, try running locust -v again. It should work correctly.

## Quick Alternatives (Temporary)
If you don't want to modify your system's PATH, you can use one of these methods.

Run with the full path: You can always run the command by providing its full location.

Shell

C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python312\Scripts\locust.exe -v
Run as a Python module: This is often the most reliable way to run Python packages from the command line, as it doesn't depend on the PATH.

Shell

python -m locust -v
